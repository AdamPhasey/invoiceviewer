# Technical Test

## Background
VetCT is a leading teleradiology and teleconsulting provider to the veterinary industry.

Clients (the veterinary clinic that has referred the patient to us) request medical referrals from VetCT, these are called "cases".  For the purposes of this exercise, a case refers to a specific instance of an animal being examined remotely by one of our specialists.

Cases are invoiced on a monthly basis to the client.

## Brief
Use the data in [data.csv](https://github.com/VetCTOrg/interview-test/blob/main/data.csv) to create an interface which enables clients to view their invoices. 

### Requirements
 - Please fork this repository and submit your attempt in the form of a public repository.
 - At VetCT we build our front end interfaces in React and Typescript, you may use a tech stack of your preference. 
 - Please follow a strict time limit of 2 hours; we do not expect a completed interface! No matter how much progress you make, we will discuss your interface in person.
